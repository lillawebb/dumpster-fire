  <h1>YO LIZ CODES</h1>
    <p> First, I'm gonna learn some basic HTML </p>
  <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of
    headings.</p>
  <h3>Lists</h3>
    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
  <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
  <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
</ul>

  <h4>Ordered Lists</h4>
    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
  <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
  <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
  <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is
      an ordered list</li></ol>

  <h5>Inline Elements</h5>
    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase</p>
    <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance
of a word or phrase.</p>
    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

<p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>
